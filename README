DB2S3 - A rails plugin to backup Mysql to Amazon S3
---------------------------------------------------
You're looking at a monthly spend of four cents
So pony up you cheap bastard, and store your backups on S3

WARNING: incremental backups are emphatically not safe for
use on a Mysql Master DB in a replicated environment.
but you're replicating, so you probably don't really need it.
You could, however, use it to backup your Mysql Slave server.


Usage:
  # In config/environment.rb
  config.gem "db2s3", :source => "http://gemcutter.org"

  # In Rakefile
  require 'db2s3/tasks'

  # In config/initializers/db2s3.rb
  DB2S3::Config.instance_eval do
    S3 = {
      :access_key_id      => 'yourkey',
      :secret_access_key  => 'yoursecretkey',
      :bucket             => 'yourapp-db-backup',
      :incremental_backup => 'true', #defaults to false
      :binlog_path        => '/path/to/binlog/' # required, if above is true
    }                                       #required trailing slash
  end
  # DB credentials are read from your rails environment

  rake gems:install

  # Add to your crontab or whatever
  rake db2s3:backup:full
  rake db2s3:backup:incremental

  # Handy tasks
  rake db2s3:statistics      # Shows you the size of your DB
  rake db2s3:backup:restore  # You should be testing this regularly
  rake db2s3:backup:clear    # Clean up old backups - cron this
